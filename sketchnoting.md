# A warm welcome to the wonderful world of sketchnoting (the software engineer perspective)

## Intro

## What is it?

## Key principles
- go fast, revisit later
- learn a few basic widgets / icons (bikablo)
- it's easy: U Z M O => light bulb example
- learn to listen.
- Graphics used by the speaker are basically freebies. Copy!

## The tools
- a tablet
- a stylus
- an app you are comfortable with
- practice
- your phone camera (to quickly capture something you want to get back to later on)
- some bluetack if working on a desk (a tablet can have a tendency to slip away)

## Sketching technical content
- It is still an ongoing challenge at the moment. 
- Software architecture diagrams are pretty easy
- Tech people are usually worse at public speaking than soft skills crews
- But they are easier to visually please :)

## conclusion
- summarize

## Intro
** Disclaimer ** I'm terrible at drawing. (Drawing of a 3yo house). I've never been able to do anything better than that house on a piece of paper. Being left handed with a horrible tendancy of smearing everything I just wrote never helped, but I don't really know, and, to be honest, I don't care.

When Apple released the iPad back in 2010, I was, like, What on Earth is this thing going to be better at than either my computer or my phone? And just dismissed the tablet thing as a whole. iOS was very limited at that time. It looked like nothing more than a trojan horse for Apple to sell more content.

Time went on.

Out of curiosity and a desire to carry around lots of books even when travelling without paying the weight toll, I got myself one a year ago. One app I also installed on was [Paper by FiftyThree](https://www.fiftythree.com/paper). There are people out there producing incredibly beautiful art with it. But for me, it was more about having something to replace my paper notebook. Today, my tablet has gained its resident seat in my messenger bag. It's also the one device I carry around in meetings. As a developer, I attend to quite a bit of tech talks. They present their own set of challenges.

But let's take a few steps back. I'll detail that later.


## What is sketchnoting?
Sketchnoting, in its essence (or how I do understand it anyway), is not about drawing beautiful things (even if a basic understanding of the key design principles, or [_gestalt_](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/28/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/), helps). For me, it's a way of tapping more directly into my memory. It goes in pair with one idea I've been a strong believer since I first sat in a meeting:

* Attendees will remember one thing. If ever. *

Not two, not three, not a few. Just one.

Sketchnoting is, for me, a way to guaranty that I'll actually remember that one thing. It has a couple of interesting side effects:

- I usually remember a bit more than one thing.
- I don't fall asleep anymore during meetings.
- I make myself and others smile (yeay!).
- I get twitter followers.

Here's a few examples of my favorite sketchnotes I've taken in the last few months.

## Key principles

### Go fast. Revisit later, maybe.
Live sketchnoting is nothing without speed. The speaker won't wait. The meeting attendees have a busy schedule. No one wants to repeat for the random dude in the background wasting everyone's important time to draw stupid pictures. And speed doesn't come from talent (at least, not for me).

Speed comes from...

### Practice
When I really got into photography a few years back, I shot _fourty thousand_ images in about twenty months. I spent about as much time on post-processing tools as I did behind the camera. Photography basically became a second full time job for 6 months to a year. I wouldn't recommend anyone to do that, unless they wanted to become _good_ and _fast_ at producing great images.

One of my favorite quotes, when I draw, design, photograph, or even write code (yeah, that happens), is unsurprisingly from a fantastic French author, Antoine de Saint Exupery. “Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” As not all speakers really understand this principle, sketchnoting is a great opportunity to get rid of all the unnecessary cruft.
In no time, I even got able to get my sketchnote posted on Twitter when the speaker would leave the stage. Achievement unlocked.

### learn a few basic widgets / icons (bikablo)
"a few of the bikablo icons"
it's easy: U Z M O => light bulb example
Don't rely on having a library of widgets and copy and pasting them. That will never be faster than knowing how to draw a set of basic symbols. We are faster at writing than copying and pasting words to make sentences, the same thing applies to sketching. Being proficient with around thirty simple symbols is pretty much all you need. If there's still doubt, my favorite tool doesn't support copy / paste. Problem solved.

### learn to filter out the important stuff
A good talk / meeting would focus on a few key ideas. That's what needs to be recorded. Anecdotes are mostly time to cleanup what's already noted down. Sometime though, if an anecdote can be quickly sketched, it can make for a good memory anchor.

### Graphics used by the speaker are freebies.
They also make a great memory anchor. Shamelessly copy!
Venn diagrams, charts, color palette... Our brain is amazing at making visual connections.
